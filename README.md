## Configuration

- **JavaScript:**
  The project utilizes JavaScript for various functionalities, including form submission and an image slider. Here's a brief overview of the JavaScript used in the project:

  - **Form Submission:**
    JavaScript code to handle form submission using AJAX, appending form data, and making a POST request to the server for user registration. It also displays alerts for successful user creation or error messages.
